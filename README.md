# Group 3 (CPSC 351)

## Getting Started

IDE preference is up to you. I recommend VSCode since there are some settings I already configured
in the `.vscode` folder.

### Visual Studio Code

 - Install [Clangd](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd) for formatting, code completion, and errors/warnings.
 - Install [cpptools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) for debugging.
